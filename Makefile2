# This rule is executed only if the object files change. Make is smart enough to
# only rebuild the object files that have change before performing the
# compilation. It will invoke $CC with $CFLAGS implicitly, so you don't need to
# specify this variable in the rule's body. Furthermore, it will
# build the .o file from the .c file if it doesn't already exist, via:
#   $: $CC -c foo.c
hellomake: hellomake.o hellofunc.o
	$(CC) -o hellomake hellomake.o hellofunc.o
